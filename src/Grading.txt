Good work!  Your program is very clean and well-organized.

Your final verse is missing one line.  It doesn't have the line
about the cow.  I took off two points for that.

For future projects, you will want to start adding comments.
Everybody does comments slightly differently, but at a minimum
it would have been good to have a comment for the set of
methods that did the verses, and a comment for the set of
methods that did the individual lines within the verses.

You did a good job realizing that a series of lines was being
repeated as a group, and putting them into a Repeat() method.
That improved efficiency.  You could have extended that same
concept even further, using the fact that JackHouse() is always
called immediately after Malt(), Malt() is always called
immediately after Rat(), etc., to build even more structure
and efficiency.  But, you get full points for Efficiency.
Well done.
